-- 1978. Employees Whose Manager Left the Company
-- Find the IDs of the employees whose salary is strictly less than $30000 and whose manager left the company. When a manager leaves the company, their information is deleted from the Employees table, but the reports still have their manager_id set to the manager that left.

-- Return the result table ordered by employee_id.

-- The result format is in the following example.

select employee_id
from employees
where manager_id is not null and salary < 30000
and manager_id not in(select employee_id from 
                  employees
                  )
order by employee_id;
